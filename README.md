# Hardware Trojan Insertion and Detection with reinforcement Learning
This repository contains:

- Test vectors generated by reinforcement learning agents to detect hardware Trojans in ISCAS-85 circuits.
The details of the inserted Trojans and the three detection techniques can be found in our papers titled: **_Trojan Playground: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Hardware Trojan Insertion and Detection_** and **_Multi-criteria Hardware Trojan Detection: A Reinforcement Learning Approach_**.

Please cite our papers if you use the hardware Trojan instances ot test vectors in your research studies:
