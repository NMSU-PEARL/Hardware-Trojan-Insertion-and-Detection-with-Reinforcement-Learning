# RL-Hardware-Trojan-Detector
This repository contains test vectors generated by a reinforcement learning agent to detect hardware Trojans in ISCAS-85 circuits. The inserted Trojans and the three detection techniques can be found in our paper titled: **_Trojan Playground: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Hardware Trojan Insertion and Detection_**. Please cite our paper if you use the test vectors in your research studies:
