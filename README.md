# RL-Hardware-Trojan-Detector
This repository contains:
- hardware Trojan instances inserted with a reinforcement learning agent in ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits
- Test vectors generated by reinforcement learning agents to detect hardware Trojans in ISCAS-85 circuits.
The details inserted Trojans and the three detection techniques can be found in our paper titled: **_Trojan Playground: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Hardware Trojan Insertion and Detection_**.

Please cite our paper if you use the test vectors in your research studies:
